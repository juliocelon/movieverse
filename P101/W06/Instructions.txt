Write an essay with simple words about : What are two things a person can do to have more perseverance?

the essay you write should have the following four paragraphs:

Introductory paragraph
Body paragraph (one thing)
Body paragraph (the other thing)
Concluding paragraph

and should fullfil the following criteria:

- The essay communicates information in an informative manner; it appeals to an audience that is unfamiliar with the essay topic
- Introductory Paragrap: The paragraph contains a strong hook that draws the reader in and gives adequate context for the essay topic; it also contains a thesis statement at the end of the paragraph that responds directly to the writing prompt and indicates two controlling ideas for the essay
- Body Paragraph: Each body paragraph has a single controlling idea within the topic sentence (first sentence of the paragraph) that ties back to the thesis statement; each paragraph also contains a supporting detail from the approved list (i.e. fact, expert testimony, statistic, personal experience) that directly supports the topic sentence; each paragraph ends with a conclusion/transition sentence
- Source Integration: At least one of the body paragraphs of the essay contains at least one credible source (i.e. current, relevant, authoritative, accurate, purposeful); that source is integrated and cited using the ICE method (introduction, citation, explanation)
- Concluding Paragraph: The paragraph revisits the main ideas from the essay, provides the reader with closure, and does not introduce a new idea
- Transitions are appropriately used between paragraphs as well as while integrating sources (see Source Integration)
